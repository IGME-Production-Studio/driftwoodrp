Welcome to Driftwood!
Driftwood is an online roleplaying tool created by roleplayers for roleplayers.

Create your account, gather your friends, and host rooms for you to map out your magic circle and have everyone share a unified vision.

Driftwood is built to be able to be used with many roleplaying games including Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder, and many more!

Engineered from an understanding in the feelings of being present in a virtual world, both in local and online environments, we built Driftwood to capture the social immersion that comes with playing roleplaying games with others.

Driftwood 2.0 was created by the following:
Cody Van De Mark
David Simkins
Gabrielle Bennett
Jake Higgins
Mario Chuman

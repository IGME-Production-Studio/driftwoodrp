	  Welcome to the Driftwood tutorial! We will show you the basics to fully use the tool. Once you join a room, you will see that there is a giant grid. This is your canvas!
	  <br/> <br/>
	  <img class="tutorial-imgs" src="static/images/tutorial-imgs/Standard.png">
	  <br/> <br/>
      You can draw on this canvas. Just click and drag on the canvas to draw strokes! To enter 'Move' mode, just press the 'M' key and you will be able to move any strokes you made. You can also delete any you've made by selecting a stroke and pressing the delete key. Finally, you can return to "Draw" mode by pressing the 'D' key
	  <br/> <br/>
	  <img class="tutorial-imgs" src="static/images/tutorial-imgs/Drawing.png">
      <br/> <br/>
	  This is the Choose Image Button! Click it to start the image uploading process!
	  <br/> <br/>
	  <img class="tutorial-imgs" src="static/images/tutorial-imgs/Choose-Image.png">
      <br/> <br/>
	  Find the image you wish to upload and press enter!
	  <br/> <br/>
	  <img class="tutorial-imgs" src="static/images/tutorial-imgs/Image-Upload.png">
      <br/> <br/>
	  Finally press on the Image Upload Button to push the image onto the canvas!
	  <br/> <br/>
	  <img class="tutorial-imgs" src="static/images/tutorial-imgs/Upload-Image.png">
      <br/> <br/>
	  Here is an image with text on the canvas as an example! Like strokes, you are able to move and delete images that you make.
	  <br/> <br/>
	  <img class="tutorial-imgs" src="static/images/tutorial-imgs/Image-Complete.png">
      <br/> <br/>	 
	  This is the Clear Room button! Click it to clear the canvas!
	  <br/> <br/>
	  <img class="tutorial-imgs" src="static/images/tutorial-imgs/Clear-Room.png">
      <br/> <br/>
	  Driftwood also comes equipped with a fully operational chat system. Use it to converse with your role playing group!
	  <br/> <br/>
	  <img class="tutorial-imgs" src="static/images/tutorial-imgs/Chat.png">
      <br/> <br/>
      You can also create monsters too! Use the already existing Pathfinder monster index or create custom monsters and NPCs of your own!
	  <br/> <br/>
	  <img class="tutorial-imgs" src="static/images/tutorial-imgs/Monster-Sidebar.png">
      <br/> <br/>
	  This is the Monster Menu! You are able to create Monsters or NPCs here! While we have some default data filled out, you're able to edit it to your heart's content!
	  <br/> <br/>
	  <img class="tutorial-imgs" src="static/images/tutorial-imgs/Monster-Menu.png">
      <br/> <br/>
	  Press the Save Button to add it to the Monster Menu! The specific Monster with its data will be saved to access for every person in the room!
	  <br/> <br/>
	  <img class="tutorial-imgs" src="static/images/tutorial-imgs/Monster-Creation.png">
      <br/> <br/>
	  Finally, to add the Monster/NPC you made to the canvas, all you need to do is drag it onto the canvas! Just like strokes and images, you can move and delete them!
